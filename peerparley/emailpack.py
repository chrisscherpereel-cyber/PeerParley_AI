"""Generate ready-to-send email files and auto-send packs.

Two flavours, both downloadable as a zip:

* **.eml pack** — one .eml per student; each opens in Outlook / Apple Mail /
  Thunderbird as a pre-filled draft (with the feedback PDF attached for results).
  You review and press Send.

* **Auto-send pack** — the attachment PDFs plus ready-to-run scripts, with every
  message baked in. The user just DOUBLE-CLICKS one file: `Send emails
  (Windows).cmd` on Windows (a tiny launcher that runs the `send_all_windows.ps1`
  engine with the execution policy bypassed, so there's no right-click / policy
  fuss) or `send_all_mac.applescript` on Mac. Their installed Outlook / Apple Mail
  then sends the whole batch (the OS asks permission the first time). A web app
  can't do this itself — the browser sandbox forbids driving your desktop mail
  app — so the work is handed to a script that runs on your machine.
